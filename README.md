# Charles Liebenberg's Code Portfolio

Welcome to my github. Currently I have three projects avaliable to view, two in Python and one with R:
## R
### 1. Predicting life expectancy with GLM's
In this project roughly 170 countries and their associated medical, educational and economic statistics are used to predict life expectancy. R was used to model, with a focus on generalised linear models.

## Python
### 2. Stock Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks 
In this project, Long Short-term Memory models were used to predict stock prices. The final model used an ensemble learning approach combining the use of a 1D Convolutional Network and a Long Short Term Model with Keras's functional API.

## 3. Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
In this project, the dataset Cifar10 was classified with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks. A final accuracy of 90.45% was achieved on external data.
